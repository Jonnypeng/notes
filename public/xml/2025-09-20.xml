    <item>So I never really got to meet her.</item>
    <item>I never really understood what they were.</item>
    <item>So I had a vision and I had a feeling when I walked in here</item>
    <item>And I fell into a deep dark hole on the internet</item>
    <item>I know the perfect spot for them</item>
    <item>But I finaly found these chairs.</item>
    <item>But apparently there is.</item>
    <item>We'll sit in this room and play the guitar</item>
    <item>The photos that you see on the wall</item>
    <item>When I have my family in town.</item>
    <item>And she just hung it on the wall.</item>
    <item>And I take on the challenge of really doing myself.</item>
    <item>I really felt like this was one of the most</item>
    <item>So then I had to return the other table to get this one.</item>
    <item>And then built up from there.</item>
    <item>And then I stumbled across this log cabin.</item>
    <item>She's had this for langer than I've been alive.</item>
    <item>Which I didn't know there was a Paris in Tennessee.</item>
    <item>Feel I'm away from the world.</item>
    <item>And when I bought this house.</item>
    <item>That is where I jump on the floor with the rugs</item>
